# vets-anni

Wynnvets **Annihilation** coordination stack — consolidates the fragmented
tools used to run the 10-player anni event into one app: a user dashboard
(App1), a Discord bot **fishbot** (`/rsvp`, App2), a staff/organizer
drag-and-drop board (App3), and later vetsmod in-game integration (App4).

Deploys as `anni.wynnvets.org` on the vets-deploy "timasca" VPS, serviced by
`manage`. One lean Python process: FastAPI + fishbot + background pollers on a
single asyncio loop.

## Discord bots in this workspace — command prefixes

fishbot's prefix-command leader is **`\`**. The vets ecosystem runs four Discord bots, each with its own prefix; the table is duplicated across each bot's repo so the mapping is discoverable from any vantage point:

| Bot | Repo | Prefix |
|-----|------|--------|
| dazebot | `../dazebot` | `~` |
| nazbot | `../temporary-server` | `!` |
| **fishbot** | `vets-anni` (this repo) | `\` |
| dynobot | (third-party, no repo) | `?` |

Slash commands (e.g. `/rsvp`) are unprefixed. The prefix only applies to text/message commands.

## Hard rules (do not violate)

- **Identity anchor is the Minecraft UUID.** Never key anything on username.
- **vets-anni uses its OWN WAPI token** (separate ratelimit bucket — mandated).
  Never reuse the dazebot/temporary-server token.
- **Online truth = mirror vetsmod `/wv list`** (merge `api.wynnvets.org`
  `/v1/outbound/{list,roster,aliases}` + WAPI guild online + grace cache).
  Never trust the bare Wynncraft server API alone.
  - **In-queue players are not offline** (see the queue state in the above)
- **Auth is intentionally low-trust** (IGN + optional password) — a
  coordination tool, not a security boundary. Documented in integration.md.
- **Colourblind variant is mandatory on every interface** — colour is never
  the only signal (glyph + label + border pattern always accompany it).
- **Single-instance-per-person** on the board: DB `unique_together(event,
  player)` on `BoardPlacement`; every move is an UPSERT in a transaction.
- **API-disabled users** (epoch `last_online`): infer via the online-merge /
  purgelist heuristic; if unconfirmable show **"unknown"** — never fabricate
  online.
- `/rsvp` replies to the user **ephemerally** but also posts a concise
  **public** confirmation line to `RSVP_CHANNEL_ID` (a record/visibility ack).
- One cross-repo addition to dazebot only: secret-gated
  `POST /api/internal/anni-identity` (reuses `verify_keys.resolve_tier`).
- **API boundary:** vets-anni is one of the three server-side projects —
  alongside `../temporary-server` and `vets-auth` — permitted to call
  dazebot's `/api/internal/*` directly. All three live on the private
  `verify` Docker network. Client-side / public-facing projects (notably
  `../vetsmod`) must route through `../temporary-server` at
  `api.wynnvets.org` and may not call dazebot directly.
- Durable docs live in `.claude/*.md` (indexed above) and stay in version
  control; link new ones here. Use `.claude/ephemeral` for temporary work.
- Tasteful comments throughout; every package has a one-responsibility
  docstring. Modular & migratable — future expansion is expected.

## Status

Build in progress, phased: **0** ✅ skeleton+deploy → **1** ✅ App1 (user
web) → **2** ✅ App3 (staff/board) → **3** App2 (fishbot) → **4** App4
(vetsmod, deferred & coordinated). See the plan file for per-phase scope +
verification.

**Phase 2 done (2026-05-18):** the staff/organizer board.
`domain/schedule.py` (pure event-phase: PENDING/GRACE/EXPIRED) +
`domain/buckets.py` (the **sole** `BoardPlacement` writer — UPSERT-in-
transaction; `move`/`assign_role`/`add_walkin`/party+organiser ops + raw
`board_rows`). `web/board_view.py` = the one JSON-able snapshot shape (SSR
**and** the socket render from it — they can't drift). `web/ws/`:
`protocol.py` (pure frames + tolerant `parse_intent`), `board_hub.py`
(server-authoritative, one `asyncio.Lock` ⇒ sequential ops = the 3rd single-
instance layer; FastAPI-free so pollers can broadcast; `get_board_hub()`
singleton). 3 new lifespan pollers: `presence_poller` (diff→PATCH + caches
`state.presence_by_uuid`), `api_disabled` (slow `/v3/player` probe →
`state.api_active_uuids`), `lifecycle_task` (grace-open then one-txn wipe:
WIN→`success_count`, purge placements/RSVPs, `wiped_at`+inactive,
`BOARD_WIPE`). Routers: `staff.py` is now the hub (status + organiser
claim + the Phase-1 password tools kept), `organizer.py` (`/staff/board`
SSR + `WS /staff/board/ws` + a REST twin for **every** mutation, all through
`board_hub.handle`), `roles_dash.py` (`/staff/roles` read view).
Templates `staff/{home,board,_board,roles}.html` + `macros/person.html`;
`static/js/board.js` (thin: WS signal ⇒ re-fetch the `#board` fragment;
SortableJS drag ⇒ MOVE) + **vendored** `sortable.min.js`; CSS board/person/
legend. 103 pytest green (~1.3 s); boots with all 7 pollers; authed board
renders all 7 status-border patterns (the CB non-colour channel).

**Phase 2 durable decisions (not derivable from code):**
- **No schema/Aerich migration** — Phase-1 models already had the full board
  schema; verified by the seeder rebuild + 103 tests on `generate_schemas`.
- **Convergence = full-snapshot PATCH** after every mutation (the simplest-
  correct model `ws_protocol.md` endorses for a low-volume tool); the
  presence poller sends *granular* `presence` ops; HELLO/reconnect ⇒ fresh
  `WELCOME` (no delta replay). **board.js never templates** — it re-fetches
  the SSR `#board` fragment on any WS signal, so there is one render path.
- **WS is tested against the hub directly** (a `FakeClient`), **not over a
  real socket**: the project test transport (httpx `ASGITransport`) has no
  websocket/lifespan by design, and a Starlette `TestClient` would cross
  event loops vs the in-memory Tortoise fixture. Intentional test-scope
  choice — the hub *is* the substance (seq/grace/single-instance/idempotency
  all covered); `organizer.board_ws` is thin glue reusing `deps.read_session`.
- **`PLAYER_ADD` is idempotent**: an already-on-board player is a no-op —
  never moved back to Unassigned, never duplicated (single-instance). The
  WS intent and the REST twin share `board_hub.handle` (one path).
- **Grace freeze is computed live** by `board_hub` via `schedule.phase_of`
  (not a stored flag) so a clock skew can't strand the board; in GRACE only
  `PARTY_SET{result,stage}` is accepted, everything else `REJECTED`.
- **api-disabled inference is best-effort secondary**: online-merge is the
  primary signal (consumed in `presence_poller`); the probe only ever *adds*
  a hidden player as `ONLINE_ELSEWHERE`, unconfirmable ⇒ `UNKNOWN` (never
  fabricate online); a failed probe carries the prior inference (per-uuid
  last-good).
- **conftest `_offline` autouse**: no unit test touches the network — the
  WAPI profile + Mojang last-resort are stubbed to "nothing found"; a test-
  body `monkeypatch` / injected `mojang=` still wins (test_auth_flow /
  test_identity unaffected). Made the suite deterministic + ~1.3 s.
- Jinja **autoescapes apostrophes** — assert an apostrophe-free slice of a
  rejected reason in rendered HTML (the raw WS-frame reason is unescaped).

**Phase 1 done (2026-05-18):** OWN-token `services/wapi.py` (priority-queue
worker, RateLimit/-429 backoff) + `tempserver.py` + AppState + 4 lifespan
pollers (stamp/staff/online_merge/weapons, copied temp-server resilience);
pure `domain/` (identity, membership, capability, attendance, presence,
roles, colourblind); low-trust `web/auth.py`; routers public(login/overview)
+ user(`/me` General+Specific, HTMX self-refresh) + capability CRUD +
**Phase-1-minimal** staff (login + password reset/rotate only — full board is
Phase 2); chips/pills/bars macros (glyph+label+pattern always emitted);
dashboard/modal/fragment templates + CSS. 52 tests green; boots end-to-end
with pollers degrading gracefully offline. **Decisions:** passwords hash with
passlib **pbkdf2_sha256**, not bcrypt (passlib 1.7.x ⨯ bcrypt 4.x self-test is
broken; also dodges the 72-byte cap). `domain/presence.py` is implemented now
(the Specific module needs it) but its live poller + full status sweep are
Phase 2. `domain/buckets.py` is intentionally absent until Phase 2 (board
mutation path). Weapons catalog is best-effort: an empty/odd WAPI result
degrades to "accepted, unverified" rather than blocking capability edits.

## External name-resolution providers

(Preemptive — no current code consumes this, but the convention is recorded so it's already in place when name → UUID or UUID → name lookups are added.)

Reliability ladder: `ashcon < wynncraft < playerdb < mojang`.

| Provider | Accuracy | Rate limit |
|---|---|---|
| ashcon | low (frequently stale) | very permissive |
| PlayerDB | medium | medium-permissive (not unlimited) |
| Wynncraft `/v3/player` | only authoritative for Wynncraft-internal state | shared with this service's other Wynncraft traffic |
| Mojang | source of truth | very restrictive |

**This repo is server-side.** We own the Mojang and PlayerDB quotas exclusively on this box, so load is predictable. Prefer accuracy when we have headroom — PlayerDB as the primary upstream, Mojang reserved for authoritative tiebreaks and writing fresh names to the cache. Skip ashcon (PlayerDB does the same job better). Stay well below each tier's budget so it's always available when truly needed.

When using a permissive provider, treat its `username` field as potentially stale (PlayerDB and ashcon are known to retain old names). Before writing a name to any long-lived cache, confirm against Mojang; if that fails, skip the cache write rather than persisting a known-stale value.

Reference implementations: dazebot's `lib/mc/mojang.py` (name → UUID via `get_mc_uuid`, UUID → name via `get_mc_username`) and temporary-server's `app/services/username_cache.py` / `app/services/guild_roster_poller.py` (Wynncraft-key-vs-cache tiebreaker pattern).
